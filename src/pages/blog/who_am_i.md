My name is Tudor ZgÃ®mbÄƒu and I am a developer, author and business enthusiast from Romania.

If you came here to learn about by technical skills and tech stack, please check my [GitHub](https://github.com/TudorZgimbau). If you want the whole story, continue reading.

I'll focus on the big picture and provide links to every project's page if you want to learn more or better understand the context.

# Early days

I started coding in my first year of high school and almost instantly felt like I've found my biggest passion. Learned the basics, started C++ in school, and found an amazing mentor (thank you, Cosmin) to get me started into some more practical coding: at that time, it was web development.

After trying both front-end and back-end development in JavaScript, I decided to focus on the server-side of things and picked up Node and Express.js. Fast forward some months, I realized I wanted to be able to finish a project without having to partner with someone to do the front layer, so I decided it was time to learn React too.

Trying to learn by building projects that interested me and focusing on mostly solo learning turned out to be both challenging and fulfilling: I was able to relatively quick "ingest" large amounts of data, but I also faced some unknowns that proved to be very hard, if not impossible, to understand for someone with my experience.

# The first breakthrough

Remember my initiative to learn React? It's what got me my first job.

I had the amazing opportunity to join the funding team of [DataZard](../projects/datazard.md) as a primarely frontend developer, which turned into a full-stack role I tried my best to master along the year we worked on our product.

This was a **huge** chance to learn:

- at a basic level, how a company or team operates
- how a startup works
- the business side of a tech product
- domain knowledge regarding brand analytics

Together with new technologies and, of course, more of the tech craft.

# Time for something else

The business side of DataZard didn't work and we had to shut down our operations. It was a very sad period, but I had to move on.

So I started searching for new things to build. After quite some time, I finally decided to build a code-sharing platform and launched [Bytecrowds](../projects/bytecrowds.md) after months of research and hard work. I consider it my R&D signature and it is, by far, the hardest thing I've ever built.

I've also won a national web olympiad presenting the project and participating in an additional 24-hours hackathon, although my imposter syndrome still bugs me from time to time ðŸ˜….

# New roles ?!

## Teaching

Something I also wanted to do is mentor other young programmers trying to get started in this challenging yet exciting field. I believe in the importance of the personal aspect in the field of education: a mentor helped me kickstart my careeer, which made things far easier than simply reading tutorials and trying to figure things out myself.

While I had plans for college, I heard about a group of passionate young guys that were trying learn various crafts such as web and game development. A teacher suggested I should talk with them so I gave it a shot and tried to mentor them by finding a common interest, which, at that time, was React.

I tried preparing materials, guiding them live, leveling up my own skill set and giving them general guidance for getting started in the field. Honestly, I'm still not sure I did a great job, but their feedback and my self-evaluation helped me improve my teaching & communication methods **a lot**.

## Doing business

Time for a new challenge, ain't it? Along with 3 of my colleagues, I participated and won the Junior section of [PoliHack](https://polihack.osut.org)2023.

I was expecting teamwork to be prioritised and we ven went a little further and tried to define a brand identity for our team. That's how [Project Cloud4](../projects/projectcloud4.md) was created.

But what I wasn't expecting is the business side of things to represent a generous portion of the judging criteria. The initial plan was for me to take care of the back-end code and help with the general technical direction of the project. The thing is, it wasn't enough: someone needed to focus on our business plan and pitch. And that someone was me.

In a team context where everyone is a stakeholder, business is rarely or never a solo craft. You have to consult with other people where appropriate, you have to stay informed about the project status and how much you can _actually_ deliever and you have to also embrace the often-lonely research work.

Some of these things came naturally, some of them posed troubles for me. I already had some
experience from my previous startup, but the hackathon required a mental model switch and the industry we were targeting (physical safety) had its own challenges.

In the end, acording to the jury, we were the best on our category so I imagine a did a fairly good job ðŸ˜Ž. I encourage you to read more about our project, [A.T.R.I.S.](https://www.projectcloud4.com/atris): someday, sometime, it might save someone's life.

# More business

Bored? Sorry, but I felt the need to write a separate chapter for this.
