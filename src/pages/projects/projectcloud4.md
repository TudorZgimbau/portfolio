# Project description

[Project Cloud4](https://www.projectcloud4.com) is a software group founded by high school students that focuses on creating software for various business or educational purposes.

You can read more about our first project, A.T.R.I.S., [here](https://www.projectcloud4.com/atris)

# My role

I helped our team create and maintain a small brand identity that allowed us to start working on our projects and pitch for a hackathon and a business bootcamp.

I have also acted as a project manager for our first project, A.T.R.I.S., coordinating the team in defining the business and technical aspects of our solution, such as:

- our business canvas
- our technical opportunities and limitations, including potential partnerships
- our pitching strategy

# Challenges

We faced a lot of challenges as an early team, including distributing responsibilities while operating in a startup environment and deciding our business model.

Short pitches, fast action, and rapid prototyping - are some of our accomplishments.
